# Third-Party Notices

This repository is not licensed as a single work. Only files explicitly identified by a component license or file-level notice receive that license. The following components retain their own licenses.

## WA2 Godot porting code

- License: Apache License 2.0
- Scope: the exact paths listed in `PORTING_CODE.md`
- Full license: `LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt`

These files are contributor-authored resource readers, runtime logic, Godot scenes, and project integration files. They are intended to work with data supplied separately by a user. The Apache-2.0 grant covers only that original implementation and does not license referenced game data or other proprietary material.

## WMV Video GDExtension

- Version: 0.6.0
- License: MIT
- Location: `addons/wmv_video`
- Copyright: WMV Video plugin contributors

The plugin source and binary are separate from original WHITE ALBUM2 game data.

## FFmpeg

- Version: 7.1.5 (`n7.1.5`, commit `3a0867c2bfda4a4d4309ca1a8cbdc6175e67f587`)
- Upstream source: https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/tree/n7.1.5
- License used by these binaries: GNU LGPL version 2.1 or later
- Full license: `addons/wmv_video/licenses/FFmpeg-LGPL-2.1-or-later.txt`

The bundled Windows and Android FFmpeg libraries are minimal shared builds. They were configured with GPL and nonfree components disabled and only the ASF demuxer, WMV/VC-1 video decoders, WMA audio decoders, `avcodec`, `avformat`, `avutil`, `swresample`, and `swscale` enabled. Users may replace the shared libraries with a compatible modified build, as permitted by the LGPL.

The optional iOS build tooling packages FFmpeg static libraries as XCFramework dependencies. An application distributor using that configuration must provide a practical way to relink the application with a modified FFmpeg, such as application object files and link instructions, or obtain a different FFmpeg license. Publishing only this plugin source does not by itself satisfy that static-linking obligation.

The exact build flags and reproducible commands are documented in `addons/wmv_video/BUILDING.md`.

Godot Engine is licensed under the MIT License. Android export templates also contain third-party components whose notices are distributed by the Godot project. See the Godot Engine license and copyright documentation for the template version used to create a release.

## Excluded proprietary material

WHITE ALBUM2 game files, media, fonts, trademarks, and other original assets are not licensed by this repository. See `ASSET_POLICY.md`.
